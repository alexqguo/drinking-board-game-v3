# Getting Started Tutorial

Welcome to the Drinking Board Game Engine! This tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know to start playing online drinking board games with your friends.

## Creating a Game

Getting started is simple:

1. **Visit the homepage** and you'll see the game creation form
2. **Select a board** from the available options (Pokemon Gen 1, Pokemon Gen 2, Zelda, etc.)
3. **Add players** by typing names and clicking "Add Player"
4. **Click "Let's go!"** to create your game

Once created, you'll be taken to your game page with a unique URL that you can share with others.

## Sharing Your Game

To invite friends to your game:

1. **Copy the game URL** from your browser's address bar
2. **Send the link** to your friends via text, Discord, or however you communicate
3. **That's it!** Anyone with the link can join your game

The game supports both local play (everyone around the same device) and remote play (friends joining from different locations).

## Selecting Your Role

When you first join a game, you'll be prompted to select a **role**:

- **ðŸŽ® Game Host**: Control all players and manage the game (great for local play)
- **ðŸ‘¤ Player Name**: Play as a specific player (perfect for remote play)

### Changing Your Role

Need to switch roles? Simply **refresh the page** and you'll be prompted to select your role again. This is useful if:

- You want to switch from host to player mode
- Someone else needs to take over as host
- You want to play as a different character

## Game Controls

### For Hosts

- **Roll dice** for any player
- **Skip turns** if someone steps away or needs a break
- **Make choices** for any player during prompts

### For Individual Players

- **Roll your dice** when it's your turn
- **Respond to prompts** that appear during gameplay
- **View your items and status** in the sidebar

## Staying in the Loop

### Game Log

**Missed what happened?** Click the **"Log"** button in the top right corner to see a complete history of all game events:

- Who rolled what
- Which spaces players landed on
- What effects were triggered
- Turn order and game state changes

### Tutorial Button

Most boards include a **ðŸ“š Tutorial** button in the sidebar that shows you the rules section of the board image - perfect for quick reference during gameplay!

## Tips for Great Gameplay

- **Explore the interface** - there are lots of fun features to discover
- **Use the game log** to track what's happening, especially in larger groups
- **Don't hesitate to skip turns** if someone needs a break
- **Have fun!** The games are designed to be social and entertaining

## Advanced Features

### Game States

The engine tracks complex game states including:

- Player effects (speed modifiers, skipped turns, etc.)
- Item inventories
- Zone-specific rules
- Turn order modifications

### Real-time Sync

All players see updates in real-time, so everyone stays synchronized regardless of their location.
